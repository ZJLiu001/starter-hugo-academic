<!-- Alice Wu is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. Her research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. She leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks. -->

I am currently pursuing a Master degree at Northwestern Polytechnical University supervised by Prof. Zhongjie Meng. I was awarded the National Second Prize in the National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest in 2019, due to which I was recommended for exemption from admission to the Master's Program. I got my bachelor's degree in Aerospace Science and Technology from Xidian University in 2021. 








My research focuses on the control of aircraft with constrained actuators and intelligent control methods to improve performance.
