-Role: Core Member

-Aim: to conduct a corrective attitude control system by using strongly constrained  actuators (the Reaction Control System, RCS) to satisfy the safety of the fuselage of a trans-medium aircraft before transmitting from air to water.

-My contribution:

*Finished simulation modeling of the object aircraft and the strongly constrained actuators;
-Designed an efficient algorithm on thrust allocation to deal with discrete and restricted output of the RCS;

*Proposed a control scheme to achieve rapid attitude adjustment and the performance of this scheme was verified by a Monte Carlo simulation experiment;

*Completed an embedded code implementation of the whole algorithm.

-Outcome: produced a first author journal paper, Fixed-time attitude control for aircraft with strongly constrained actuators, which was accepted in Aerospace Science and Technology.
