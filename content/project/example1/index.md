- Role: Core Member
- Aim: to design controllers to improve the control performance of a kind of airship which consists of flexible airbags, ropes, and pods in strong winds.
- My contribution:
  * Contributed to the design of a control command distribution system for longitudinal and lateral channels of an airship for heterogeneous actuators;
  * Collected information and had a sharp insight into the concept of impedance control;
  * Participated in the design of the controller for airship that can adapt to the strong wind-gust disturbances.
- Outcome:
Produced a third-author paper, Impedance-Based Stable Control for Autonomous Airship with Strong Wind-Gust Disturbance, which was Under Review.
