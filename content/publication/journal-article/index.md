abstract: This paper investigates a novel fixed-time attitude control method for trans-medium aircraft to ensure
proper contact between the fuselage and the new medium before transmitting from different environmental
mediums. How to achieve rapid corrective attitude adjustment from improper contact by utilizing
the Reaction Control System with multiple discrete thrust gears that possess discrete thrusts with limited
output has become a great challenge. To solve this problem, a novel fixed-time attitude controller is proposed.
Firstly, a non-singular segmented terminal sliding mode surface is constructed to achieve a fixed
convergence time and avoid the singularity problem. Subsequently, a command regulator is designed to
cope with the derivation introduced by the strongly constrained actuators, which consists of the approximate
thrust model and an auxiliary system based on a double power function. Furthermore, the stability
analysis indicates the fixed time convergence stability of the closed-loop system and provides a clear
calculation of the settling time. Finally, numerical comparison results and Monte Carlo simulations verify
that the attitude can converge in a predetermined time from different initial states.
